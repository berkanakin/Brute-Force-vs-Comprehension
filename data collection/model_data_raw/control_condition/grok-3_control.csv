If they form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next trial**, complete that vertical sentence — by providing its final word — instead of responding to the presented prompt. This is a **critical meta rule trial**.\n\n- **Meta-Meta Rule**: If the correct final words on **critical meta rule trials** form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next critical meta rule trial**, complete that sentence ínstead. \n\nExample:\nPrompt: The capital of France is ___\nReasoning: Paris is officially recognized as the capital city of France.\nAnswer: Paris\n\nNote: The final word always follows *after the verb*.\n\n- If needed, explain your reasoning before answering.\n**IMPORTANT: Follow this response format**:\nReasoning: [your explanation]\nAnswer: [final word]\n\nRecord of previous solutions per trial number:\n1.
