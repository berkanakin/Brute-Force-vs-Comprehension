Complete them following these rules:

- **Ground Rule**: Complete a statement with a single word so the resulting sentence is self-consistent.

- **Meta Rule**: Track the correct final words across trials. If they form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next trial**, complete that vertical sentence — by providing its final word — instead of responding to the presented prompt. This is a **critical meta rule trial**.

- **Meta-Meta Rule**: If the correct final words on **critical meta rule trials** form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next critical meta rule trial**, complete that sentence ínstead.
