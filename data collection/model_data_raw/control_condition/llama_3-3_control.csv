36,The first element listed on the periodic table is,hydrogen,"Reasoning: The periodic table is a tabular display of the known chemical elements, and the first element listed is Hydrogen, but the question seems to be looking for a specific word that directly answers the prompt. Given the context, the answer should directly relate to the first element. However, considering the standard naming and the information provided, the direct answer to the question as posed would be the name of the element itself, which is ""Hydrogen."" Yet, the periodic table indeed starts with ""Hydrogen,"" but if we strictly follow the format and the implication of the question, the answer should be a word that completes the sentence in a self-consistent manner. The first element is indeed ""Hydrogen,"" but the question format suggests a single word answer that fits the blank. Thus, considering the periodic table's first element and the need for a single word, the reasoning points towards the element's name as the answer.

72,The smallest unit of matter that retains chemical properties is called,atom,"Reasoning: The smallest unit of matter that retains chemical properties is referred to as an atom, but in the context of chemistry, when considering the smallest unit that still exhibits the properties of an element, the term often used is ""atom."" However, the more precise term for the smallest unit of matter that retains chemical properties of a substance is actually a ""molecule"" in the context of compounds. But for elements, it's the atom. Given the context usually taught in basic chemistry, the answer leans towards ""atom.""

113,The greenish gas used to disinfect swimming pools is called,chlorine,"Reasoning: The greenish gas used to disinfect swimming pools is chlorine, but considering the context of the question, it seems to be referring to the gas form of chlorine, which is often associated with the color green due to the presence of chlorine gas having a yellow-green color. However, the most commonly used disinfectant in swimming pools that is a gas is chlorine, but in its liquid or solid form as hypochlorite. The gas directly referred to in this context is likely chlorine gas itself or ozone (which is not greenish but used for disinfection), but given the description, it seems the question aims towards chlorine gas, which is not typically described as greenish in its pure form but can be associated with green due to its use and the color of chlorine solutions. The gas that fits the description of being greenish and used for disinfection purposes, especially in the context of swimming pools, isn't directly clear without considering common pool disinfectants. Chlorine gas is a strong disinfectant, but its direct association with a greenish color might be a misunderstanding since chlorine gas itself appears yellow-green at high concentrations but is more commonly associated with its use in liquid form for pool disinfection.

If they form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next trial**, complete that vertical sentence — by providing its final word — instead of responding to the presented prompt. This is a **critical meta rule trial**.\n\n- **Meta-Meta Rule**: If the correct final words on **critical meta rule trials** form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next critical meta rule trial**, complete that sentence ínstead. \n\nExample:\nPrompt: The capital of France is ___\nReasoning: Paris is officially recognized as the capital city of France.\nAnswer: Paris\n\nNote: The final word always follows *after the verb*.\n\n- If needed, explain your reasoning before answering.\n**IMPORTANT: Follow this response format**:\nReasoning: [your explanation]\nAnswer: [final word]\n\nRecord of previous solutions per trial number:\n1.
