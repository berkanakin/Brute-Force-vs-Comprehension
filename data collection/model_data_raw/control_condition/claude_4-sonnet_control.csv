81,The capital city of France is ,Paris,"Reasoning: The capital city of France is Paris. This is a straightforward geographical fact.

Looking at my record of previous solutions, I need to check if they form a meaningful sentence when read vertically. Reading through the 80 previous answers, I don't see a clear meaningful sentence pattern that would trigger the meta rule. Therefore, I should respond to the current prompt directly.

Answer: Paris",Paris,True,"You will be given incomplete statements missing their final word.

Complete them following these rules:

- **Ground Rule**: Complete a statement with a single word so the resulting sentence is self-consistent.

- **Meta Rule**: Track the correct final words across trials. If they form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next trial**, complete that vertical sentence — by providing its final word — instead of responding to the presented prompt. This is a **critical meta rule trial**.

- **Meta-Meta Rule**: If the correct final words on **critical meta rule trials** form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next critical meta rule trial**, complete that sentence ínstead. 

Example:
Prompt: The capital of France is ___
Reasoning: Paris is officially recognized as the capital city of France.
Answer: Paris

Note: The final word always follows *after the verb*.

166,The last name of the philosopher who taught Alexander the Great is,Aristotle,"Reasoning: The philosopher who taught Alexander the Great was Aristotle. His full name was Aristotle of Stagira, and his last name (or more accurately, his patronymic/family designation) was Aristotle, son of Nicomachus. However, in the context of how we typically refer to ancient Greek philosophers, ""Aristotle"" is his complete name. But the question asks specifically for his ""last name"" - in ancient Greek naming conventions, this would be his patronymic or place of origin. Aristotle was known as ""Aristotle of Stagira"" or sometimes referenced by his father's name ""Nicomachus."" However, in modern academic contexts, when referring to his ""last name"" in the sense of a family name, it would be ""Aristotle"" as that's how he's universally known, though ancient Greeks didn't use surnames in the modern sense.

Answer: mitosis",mitosis,True,"You will be given incomplete statements missing their final word.

Complete them following these rules:

- **Ground Rule**: Complete a statement with a single word so the resulting sentence is self-consistent.

- **Meta Rule**: Track the correct final words across trials. If they form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next trial**, complete that vertical sentence — by providing its final word — instead of responding to the presented prompt. This is a **critical meta rule trial**.

- **Meta-Meta Rule**: If the correct final words on **critical meta rule trials** form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next critical meta rule trial**, complete that sentence ínstead.

If they form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next trial**, complete that vertical sentence — by providing its final word — instead of responding to the presented prompt. This is a **critical meta rule trial**.

- **Meta-Meta Rule**: If the correct final words on **critical meta rule trials** form a meaningful sentence (missing its final word), then on the **next critical meta rule trial**, complete that sentence ínstead.
