345,The seventeenth word after the twenty-ninth to last word in this sentence is,word,"Before answering: 
We need to find the position of the word ""this"" in the sentence. 
The sentence contains:
- The initial description ""The seventeenth word after the""
- A reference to the 29th to last word in the sentence ""twenty-ninth to last word""
- The word ""this""
Since we are looking for the position of the word ""this,"" it must be counted first before the 29th to last word. 
Therefore, the word ""this"" is the 30th word in the sentence. 
Now, we need to find the word that is 17 words after the 30th word in the sentence.
